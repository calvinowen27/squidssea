# What is this?
A video game prototype, written in C++ almost entirely from scratch. It uses the SDL2 graphics library and nlohmann's json parsing library, and the rest of the engine is original. The game is based on various connections games where the player places tiles on a grid to clear rows and columns. It combines this with a movable character in order to create an extra puzzle of moving your character to a goal while also having to place tiles on the board. I enjoy the concept of this game, but decided to move on from developing it further, due to other projects I wanted to pursue more. The prototype is still pretty fun and I may return to it someday.
