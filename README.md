# What is this?
A video game, currently in development, written in C++ almost entirely from scratch. It uses the SDL2 graphics library and nlohmann's json parsing library, and the rest of the engine is original. The game's core mechanic is the ability to create magic spells which help the player fend of enemies. The spells can be created from a selection of different attributes, each combination creating a unique spell with unique characteristics. The spell attributes currently implemented are Projectile, Radial, and Chain.
